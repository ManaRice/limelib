# limelib

A very much work in progress c library with useful datastructures.
At the moment I'm just adding features when I need them, some are
leaky and cannot be destroyed yet, but they should become better
when I need them too.

The Makefile creates a shared object in ../../utils/ at my computer
because that is in my PATH, but change and/or remove as needed
